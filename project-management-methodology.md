#### SDLC model/methodologies
* Waterfall
* Agile
* spiral
* rapid prototyping,
* incremental
* synchronize and stabilize
#### SDLC Phases
* Planning(Resource allocation, Capacity planning, Project scheduling, Cost estimation). Some people do not consider it.
* Requirements analysis(output SRS)
* Design and prototyping
* Software development
* Testing
* Deployment
* Operations and maintenance

#### Waterfall
* Waterfall works best for projects completed in a linear/sequential fashion and does not allow going back to a prior phase.
* originated in construction and manufacturing—industries where one phase must be completed before another begins.
* projects are broken down into linear and sequential stages, where every piece of the project relies on the completion of preceding deliverable.
* Any revision requires restarting the entire process.
* Because Waterfall does not allow going back to a prior phase, project requirements need to be clear up front.
* Less flexibility.

#### Agile
* It is a collaborative, self-organizing,iterative , cross-functional approach to completing work and requirements.
* Agile focuses on adaptive, simultaneous workflow.
* Agile methods break projects into smaller, iterative periods, which work particularly well for products that benefit from user testing and regular revision.
* Agile methodologies encourage teams to improve and adjust workflow as needed.

#### Scrum and Kanban
* Kanban and scrum are frameworks that help teams adhere to agile principles and get stuff done.

##### Scrum
* Deliver the business value in the shortest time.
* Use Scrum
  * Best for teams with stable priorities that may not change as much over time.
  * Scrum for feature-driven work with big release goals or milestones.
* Scrum’s Sprint time box.
* Scrum process
  * Daily Scrum
  * Sprint Planning Meeting
  * Sprint Retrospective
* Cadences is defined by sprint
* KPI: Burndown chart, Velocity chart
  
##### Kanban
* Use Kanban
   * Best for projects with widely-varying priorities.
   * Kanban for incoming small pieces of work such as defect fixes or small enhancement requests.
* Kanban’s WIP Limit
* It makes problems like bottlenecks highly visible, allowing the team to make corrections as needed.
* Kanban process
  * Continuous Improvement
  * Visualize Work and Focus on flow
  * Limit work in process
* Cadences is defined by WIP
* KPI: Lead time, Cycle time
* The team meets periodically to discuss changes that need to be made, and the data displayed on the Kanban board guides these discussions.
* When there’s available capacity, your team just pulls a new work item towards “In Progress” according to its priority
* Ensure agility and delivering value frequently, and at the right time. As WIP limits prevent team members to work on multiple tasks at once, everybody commits to finishing what they have started before engaging in new work.

#### Self Organizing Team
* A self-organizing team is one that does not depend on or wait for a manager to assign work. Instead, these teams find their own work and manage the associated responsibilities and timelines
* Self-organizing teams also take on the responsibility of choosing the most effective and efficient way to complete their work and regularly look for ways to improve through experimentation.
* Self-organizing teams must have a high `sense of ownership and responsibility`. Equally as important, they need to `communicate often and trust in the capabilities of everyone` on the team.
* Self-organizing teams don’t require a manager to assign work, set deadlines, and so on, they do require a mentor who can help grow their skills.

Lead time : new task’s appearance in your workflow and its final departure from the system
Cycle time : new task’s enters the “in progress” stage and somebody is actually working on it
